# Code_Book

* The subjects for test and train are in different files. these files are read as vector file and then assembled into the X_Test and X_train files.
* Column headers are also read as a character vector. This vector is labeled with activity lables before reading test and train data.
* The comments in the the program itself explain hoe the prgram is structured and what the line of code is doing.
* The comments in the program also discuss which step from the project is being executed by the code.
* The program will create a "TidySet.txt" in the proj folder
* This program is written by me and submitted by me as a part of completing this course

## Variables 

1. Activity - Describes data collected on a particular activity
2. Subect - Subjects are numbered from 1 to 30
3. 3:22 Time domain mean accelerations, Gravity Acceleration, Jerk, Gyro... in all three XYZ co-ordinates are described 
4. 23: 48 : information of mean frequency domain
5. 49: 55 : information on means of relative angles between the acceleration and gravity, Gyro.
6. 56:75 : information on mean standard deviation of the observations
7. 76: 88 : Information on the mean frequency domain readings.

Here are the coloumn names
